Jamf Pro
======

This repo will contain content I have created while managing a Jamf Pro environment.

Everything in this repo is configured for a use in Jamf Pro, however, almost everything can be converted to work in another management solution.

**Admin Tools** - Scripts, etc, that are mainly intended for Full Jamf Pro Admins

**Extension Attributes** - Various EAs that I have created

**Reporting** - A collection of workflows, scripts, SQL queries, and notes for reporting on a Jamf environment.

**Scripts** - Various scripts for managing devices in Jamf Pro

**Site Admin Tools** - Various "tools" I have created that help provide additional functionality for Site Admins that is not natively available.  Also "helper" tools, and tools that can be used to get information on a system.
